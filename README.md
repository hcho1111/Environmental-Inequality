# Environmental-Inequality
This contains the data and code I utilized to build an economic model detailing air quality levels depending on one's socioeconomic characteristics. 

I did not include any code, as raw data exceed github's repository limit. Please contact me if you wish to recieve the code and I can import it to you. 

Included are my presentation, poster, thesis, and STATA.do file for this project. They encompass all the significant parts of my project, specifically the results and anlysis.
